description: "Product/Market Fit is a common concept in the startup world. While widely applied in conversations around new high-growth companies, it doesn't seem to have caught on in the rest of the business world yet. It deserves to be more widely understood, because it's a useful Mental Model for the interplay between a business, it's products, and it's customers."
