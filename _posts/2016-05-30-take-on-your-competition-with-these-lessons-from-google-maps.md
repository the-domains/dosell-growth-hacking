From a scan of his resume, this may not seem to be true: MS in CS at Stanford; joined Google in 2003 and helped lead the team that co-created Google Maps; co-founded and was CEO of FriendFeed, which was successfully sold to Facebook in 2009; became CTO of Facebook until 2012; and finally co-founded and is currently CEO of startup Quip , which recently raised $30 million from Greylock and Benchmark.'
